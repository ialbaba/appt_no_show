Machine Learning to Predict Appointment No-Shows

First part of the notebook is dedicated to data cleaning and exploration. 
In the second part, we built and trained 4 models (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistical Regression, & Random Forest) to predict the probability that a patient will not show up to their appointment. 

We've included our paper that outlines the functionality, tools, methods, and conclusions of our data analysis.
