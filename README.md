Machine Learning to Predict Appointment No-Shows

First part of the notebook is dedicated to data cleaning and exploration. 
In the second part, we built and trained 4 models (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistical Regression, & Random Forest) to predict the probability that a patient will not show up to their appointment. 

We've included a research paper that outlines the functionality, tools, methods, and conclusions of our data analysis.

no_show.csv is the original dataset that we used to make our analysis. It was downloaded off Kaggle.
