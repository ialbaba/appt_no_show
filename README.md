Machine Learning to Predict Appointment No-Shows

First part of the notebook is doley dedicated to data cleaning and exploration. 

In the next part, we built and trained 4 models (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistical Regression, & Random Forest) to predict the probability that a patient will not
show up to their appointment. 

The last bits of the code are inputting random data and seeing how our model will respond to it. 

We've included our paper that outlines the functionality, tools, methods, and conclusions of our data analysis.
